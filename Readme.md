# How to create a document map (bookmarks)


<p>This example introduces the concept of creating a document map (table of contents) for the Document. It draws five bricks in the Detail section of a document, and then adds bookmarks to the document map for each document brick. Note that the Document Map button of the Print Preview Form's toolbar is enabled automatically if a document contains any bookmarks in its document map.</p>
